\subsection{Problem Definition and Goal}
The amount of data collected every day is growing uncompromisingly. Further Proliferation of the Internet, Social Networks, 
Search queries and increasing networking of IoT devices and sensors means that the amount of data is growing exponentially. 
To remain competitive in their respective markets, companies must be able to extract value from the large amount of data.
 A conzept that decisively supports companies in exactly this task is Big Data. Big Data encompasses the entire process of data collection to analyzing it
 When combined with machine learning, Big Data unfolds its full potential. The combination allows very large data sets to be processed, 
 which is incredibly valuable for companies. This enables companies to capture their macro and microenvironment in data and create deciding business value. 
 Due to its wide range of applications, this field offers opportunities for improvement for companies of all kinds. 
 Even companies from the entertainment industry, such as Spotify, Netflix or Disney are already using these practices to improve the services they offer, 
 to differentiate themselves from the competition and to make the customer experience unique. 
 Spotify for example uses Big Data to give its users an individual Discover Weekly Playlist which consists of thirty recommended songs for that user. 
 This project has the purpose to illustrate and solve a real-world big data-related problem that could also occur in a company's Value creation process. 
 For this purpose, algorithms are applied to the solution within a controlled framework. Based on the \ac{CRISP DM} process, the data used was first collected, analyzed, 
 and finally evaluated. The problem to be solved is classifying songs using pre-generated features provided by Spotify for each music track on their platform. 
 For the classification, predefined genres by Spotify are taken as categories.

The final goal of this paper is to apply a gradient boosting algorithm to a dataset collected from Spotify. 
This algorithm should be trained during the course of the project and be able to assign songs to selected genres in the final product. 
Along the way, the basics of Big Data itself, but also the working models and processes used in the project/model should be presented 
in their theoretical form and explained clearly. Since not explicitly given, the individual collection of data by means of a given API (written out) 
in combination with own coding shall find place as part of the model in an extra step. 
Additionally, this paper should cover all the steps of the \ac{CRISP DM} model, and furthermore be an example of how Big Data projects can be approached 
and performed in this style of work. Besides the Coding, the mechanisms of the Spotify algorithm and the mechanisms inside Spotify as a company are 
explicitly explained to guarantee an overall good understanding of the whole project.

\subsection{Structure and Methodology of the Assignment}
The thesis is divided into four main sections. It starts with an introduction, containing a problem statement, goal and structure of the paper. 
Following the introduction, which contains the basics of Big Data as a whole with focus on the concepts used in the project as well as basics of music theory. 
The practical part, which explains the coding and procedure used in the project in more detail and finally a conclusion part with summary and conclusion of the project and the work. 
The basic part deals with the concepts of Big Data as a whole, including the relevance of data, the 4V matrix, the storage of data and the associated data formats, 
Big Data analytics and methods of learning algorithms. Further, this chapter explains in more detail how gradient boosting algorithms work, 
since such an algorithm was used in the project. In addition, the functionality of CRISP DM as the modeling process used is explained. 
Since a separate data set was produced for the data collection, the principles of so-called API's are presented in the theoretical form. 
The basics of music conclude this chapter. These are important to get a perspective for the facts of the project. 
All of these points will be referred to further in the rest of the thesis, so it is important to build this foundation first.
The practical part follows the steps of the CRISP DM model. Business Understanding can be omitted as a part here, because the model was developed in the course of a project work. 
Therefore, this chapter starts with the Data Collection, in this case the development of the API to collect the used data set. 
It continues with the so-called Data Understanding, where both the origin of the data (Spotify algorithm) and the meaning of the individual labels are explained, 
and finally put in relation to each other. It continues with the Data Preparation, the preparation of the data for the algorithm, followed by the modeling itself. 
At the end an evaluation of the whole project and the result follows.
The basics of Big Data concepts explained in this thesis are derived from renowned book sources. 
Further numbers, data and facts, which cannot be read out of reference books (e.g. information about Spotify as a company) 
are proven with the help of suitable sources from the internet. Everything else is covered by own coding and with the help of the concepts introduced in the basic part 
understandably reinforced and explained.
