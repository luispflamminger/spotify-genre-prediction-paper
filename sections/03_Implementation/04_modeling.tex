\subsection{Modeling}

\subsubsection{The Classifier}

For training the Gradient Boosting Algorithm, the GradientBoostingClassifier class from 
scikit learn is used. It is part of a group of classes offering all sorts of ensemble methods.
As explained in \{Grundlagenteil Schwabe\} ensemble methods combine the predictions of several
weak learners to generate a more robust model and reduce overfitting issues.
sklearn supports averaging methods like Bagging and Random Forests, which take the average of each learners prediction
as their output. It also supports Boosting Methods like AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting, which
build base estimators sequentially improving the output each time. Sklearn also provides 
a classifier and regressor model for each method.

The Gradient Boosting Classifier supports binary and multi-class classification and uses
20 hyperparameters to control the size of each regression tree, the number of trees,
the learning rate and many more. The most impactful of these parameters are explained here.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{learning\_rate}
    
    As explained in section \ref{sec:Gradient Boosting Algorithm}, the learning rate is used to control how
    much each tree contributes to the result, by multiplying it with the output values of the previous 
    tree. The default value here is 0.1
    \item \textbf{n\_estimators}

    The number of weak learners to be used while boosting. The default is 100.
    \item \textbf{max\_depth}

    The maximum depth of each regression tree. This also impacts its number of nodes.
    The default value is 3.
    \item \textbf{loss}

    The type of loss function to be used. Possible values are deviance and exponential.
    Deviance describes how well a logistic regression model, in our case the regression tree,
    fits the data. A deviance of 0 would be a perfect fit, the higher the number, the worse the fit.


    \item \textbf{criterion}
    \item \textbf{min\_samples\_split}
    \item \textbf{min\_samples\_leaf}
    \item \textbf{max\_features}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cross Validation}
\{explain cross validation here\}

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}

Sklearn also provides methods for Hyperparameter tuning. In this project, Exhaustive Grid Search was used to 
tune hyperparameters. To perform this search, the class GridSearchCV can be used. It takes an 
estimator, in our case the Gradient Boosting Classifier, and a grid of parameters.
In this case, the hyperparameters are the parameters of GradientBoostingClassifier as 
explained above. This codeblock shows a parameter grid, as it is defined in this project.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    param_grid = {
        "loss": ["deviance", "exponential"],
        "n_estimators": [97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103],
        "learning_rate": [0.8, 0.9, 0.1, 0.11, 0.12],
        "criterion": ['friedman_mse', 'squared_error'],
        "min_samples_split": [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3],
        "min_samples_leaf": [1],
        "max_depth": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        "random_state": [42],
        "max_features": [None, 0.95, 0.90]
}
\end{lstlisting}

The parameter grid is given as a Python dictionary containing the parameter name as keys and 
an array of values for each key. Additionaly a GradientBoostingClassifier object is defined 
and both are passed into the GridSearchObject.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=45)    
    search = GridSearchCV(gbc, param_grid)
\end{lstlisting}

The search object's fit method combines cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning and classifier
fitting to find the best possible combination of hyperparameters to the estimator for the given dataset.
This is done in the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An estimator is created using the first combination of hyperparameters. In the current
    example, this is equivalent to creating the following estimator.
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
        estimator = GradientBosstingClassifier(loss="deviance", n_estimators=97, learning_rate=0.8, criterion='friedman_mse', min_samples_split=1, min_samples_leaf=1, max_depth=1, random_state=42, max_features=None)
    \end{lstlisting}
    \item The newly created classifier is fitted to the training data using this set of parameters using 5-fold cross validation.
    When this is done, an average of the five scores resulting from cross-validation is built.
    This average is now used as the score for this specific combination of parameters.
    \item The score is saved together with the parameters
    \item All of the above steps are repeated with every possible combination of parameters from the 
    parameter grid. This results in a score for every set of parameters.
    \item As every model was fitted using the same method, it is clear that the model with the highest
    score is using the best hyperparameters. A new model is trained without cross-validation so using all
    data, to create the final model using the best parameters.
\end{enumerate}

The model created by grid search can then be evaluated using test data that was not used in cross validation.
Executing this GridSearch in Python is done be calling the fit method of the search object defined in the code above 
using the train features and labels.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    search.fit(X_train, y_train)
\end{lstlisting}

After fitting, the search object can be used as if it was a normal estimator built with the optimal 
hyperparameters.
To see, which hyperparameters were optimal, the get\_params can be used.
It's output looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    {'cv': 5,
    'error_score': nan,
    'estimator__ccp_alpha': 0.0,

        'n_estimators': [97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103],

        'criterion': ['friedman_mse', 'squared_error'],

        'min_samples_leaf': [1],

        'random_state': [42],

    'pre_dispatch': '2*n_jobs',
    'refit': True,
    'return_train_score': False,
    'scoring': None,
    'verbose': 0}
\end{lstlisting}

All fields starting with "estimator\_\_" contain the optimal hyperparameters for the data.
Even though a broad spectrum of values was given in the search grid, most of the optimal values 
are equal to the default values given by sklearn. This might suggest, that the developers
set the default values using a similar dataset to the one used in this project.

Although many combinations were evaluated, there is still a possibility, that this is a local 
maximum and a set of hyperparameters that is far different from the ones tested here are actually
optimal. Trying out every possible combination of values would require a great amount of 
computing resources, as the Grid Search shown above already took more than 1.5 hours on a 
modern 16 core CPU.

Finally the model can be evaluated using the test set defined previously. This set has never been 
seen by the model even while doing cross validation.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    search.score(X_test, y_test)
\end{lstlisting}

The estimators score function shows a 86.286\% accuracy for the final model using the test set.
