\subsection{Application Programming Interfaces}

This section gives an overview over the basic concepts\cite[S.1]{reddy2011api} and technologies behind \acp{API}.

\subsubsection{Purpose and Usage}

An \acp{API} is an interface between two pieces of software.\cite[S.1]{reddy2011api}
These might run on the same machine and communicate locally, in the case of a desktop application for example,
or on seperate machines that are connected via some network,
e.g. in a client/server application.

\acp{API} provide a readily implemented solution to a problem
in programming and can be reused , how the \ac{API} can be used to solve it.
\acp{API} such a problem might be finding some value in an array,
fetching a file from a hard drive, or getting the latest weather data from a weather service.
